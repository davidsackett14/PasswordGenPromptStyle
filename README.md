# Password Generator Prompt Style
Password generator built using JavaScript prompts
## <em> Purpose </em>
This assignment was an opportunity to further understand the usage of JavaScript. The password generator functions mainly through input received through prompts, using if and else/if statements and for loops.
I hope to be able to create further interactivity within this generator in the future and condense the code further. I also look forward to doing this project using alternative coding methodology and possibly some other bootstrap elements such a slider or check boxes for character type selection. 
### <em> Resources </em>
I used several resources to understand the concepts enough to utilize them in a singular application.
These resources include:

as well as the tutalage provided by the instructor and teachers assistants through the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp program
